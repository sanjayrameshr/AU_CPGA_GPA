## How It Works

### GPA Calculation
- Each semester page passes a list of `Subject` objects (`name`, `credits`, `grade`) to `calculatePage.dart`.
- GPA is calculated as:
```bash
  [
  GPA = \frac{\sum(\text{Grade Point} \times \text{Credit})}{\sum(\text{Credits})}
  ]
```
### CGPA Calculation
- The user selects the **number of semesters completed**.
- App knows the **fixed credit values** for each semester:
```

[22, 26, 25, 22, 21, 20, 16, 10]

````
- CGPA is computed as:
```bash
[
CGPA = \frac{\sum(\text{Semester GPA} \times \text{Credits})}{\sum(\text{Credits})}
]
```
